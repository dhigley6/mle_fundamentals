This repo contains reviews of and resources on fundamental machine learning engineer skills.
Topics reviewed here are fundamental in the sense that they are applicable to wide ranges of machine learning engineering and unlikely to become obsolete quickly.
  Machine learning engineers must work closely and effectively with a variety of people in order to be successful. Thus, soft skills are covered as fundamental in this repo.
  In contrast, things like libraries which may be supplanted over time or research which is not yet found wide application in industry are not covered.

It is not expected that all practicing machine learning engineers would have mastery of all the topics that could be covered here.
  There is a lot of information in even the fundamentals of machine learning engineering and one does not have to have mastered all of it to effectively contribute.
  Similarly, this is not a comprehensive resource on the fundamentals of machine learning engineering. 
    Rather, I am adding topics over time according to their importance and my interest/exposure to them.
