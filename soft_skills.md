## Project Management



## Giving and Receiving Feedback

- Be open to feedback
- Accept when you messed up and that you could have done better
- Take actionable steps to improve in the future
- Ask for clarification in areas that you disagree. Not all feedback will be applicable or realistic. You don't have to be a pushover.

## Managing Priorities and Deadlines

- Understand the higher-level goals of the team/project and align our priorities with this
- 


## Handling Ambiguity

- Ask clarifying questions
- Gather data to build or verify a hypothesis
- Understand who the domain experts are and leverage their knowledge
- Don't try to boil the ocean. Limit the scope of the problem initially
- Compromising with partner teams on features/functionality
- Forming a short-term/long-term action plan
- Formulating and communicating the trade-offs of various approaches


## Handling Conflicts

- Try to understand the other person's point of view
- Have clear, logical rationale for your position
- Use objective data to argue your point
- Seek mediation from senior engineers/managers if a consensus cannot be reached
- Accept the outcome regardless of being right or wrong and move forward

### Convincing others of your perspective/idea

- Use facts and data to present an objective argument to the other party
- Fully understand the other party's point of view and take this into account in our proposed solution
-
